• Long-term corticosteroid therapy
• Recent minor surgery (cholecystectomy)

Presenting Symptoms:
Elisabeth Zhu, a 48-year-old female with a known history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and long-term corticosteroid therapy, presented with progressive dyspnea over the past week. She described experiencing chest tightness, particularly noticeable during exertion. Additionally, she reported significant fatigue and malaise, impacting her daily activities.
